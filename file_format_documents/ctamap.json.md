# ctgmap.json Documentation

The `ctgmap.json` file contains information about contig mappings between a reference genome and query contigs. It is generated by the `pgr-alnmap` tool and provides detailed alignment information in a JSON format.

## File Structure

The `ctgmap.json` file contains a single JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "records": [...],
  "query_length": [...],
  "target_length": [...]
}
```

### Records

The `records` field is an array of objects, where each object represents a contig mapping. Each mapping object has the following structure:

```json
{
  "t_name": "string",
  "ts": number,
  "te": number,
  "q_name": "string",
  "qs": number,
  "qe": number,
  "ctg_len": number,
  "orientation": number,
  "ctg_orientation": number,
  "t_dup": boolean,
  "t_ovlp": boolean,
  "q_dup": boolean,
  "q_ovlp": boolean
}
```

- `t_name`: Name of the target (reference) sequence
- `ts`: Start position of the alignment on the target sequence
- `te`: End position of the alignment on the target sequence
- `q_name`: Name of the query contig
- `qs`: Start position of the alignment on the query contig
- `qe`: End position of the alignment on the query contig
- `ctg_len`: Length of the query contig
- `orientation`: Orientation of the alignment (0 for forward, 1 for reverse)
- `ctg_orientation`: Orientation of the entire contig alignment
- `t_dup`: Boolean indicating if the target region is duplicated
- `t_ovlp`: Boolean indicating if the target region overlaps with other alignments
- `q_dup`: Boolean indicating if the query region is duplicated
- `q_ovlp`: Boolean indicating if the query region overlaps with other alignments

### Query Length

The `query_length` field is an array of tuples containing information about query contig lengths:

```json
[
  [id, "name", length],
  ...
]
```

- `id`: Numeric identifier for the query contig
- `name`: Name of the query contig
- `length`: Length of the query contig in base pairs

### Target Length

The `target_length` field is an array of tuples containing information about target (reference) sequence lengths:

```json
[
  [id, "name", length],
  ...
]
```

- `id`: Numeric identifier for the target sequence
- `name`: Name of the target sequence
- `length`: Length of the target sequence in base pairs

## Usage

The `ctgmap.json` file can be used for various downstream analyses, including:

1. Visualizing contig alignments
2. Identifying potential structural variations
3. Assessing the quality of genome assemblies
4. Comparing different assemblies or genome versions

To work with the `ctgmap.json` file, you can use any JSON parser in your preferred programming language to load and process the data.
